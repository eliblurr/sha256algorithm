# Sha256algorithm

Sha256 algorithm explained online step by step visually [sha256algorithm.com](https://sha256algorithm.com/)
This website will help you understand how a sha256 hash is calculated from start to finish.

I hope this will be helpful for students learning about hash functions and sha256.

The code it's quite messy and probably there are some parts that don't follow the react way.

`npm install`

and start local server:

`npm start`
